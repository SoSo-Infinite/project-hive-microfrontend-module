Project HIVE: High-Performance Micro-Frontend Module

This module serves as a core demonstration of superior frontend architectural practices, focusing on performance, reactive state management, and modularity.

Architectural Focus

Reactive Signals Architecture: Utilizes Angular's cutting-edge Signals API for granular change detection and optimized rendering, essential for low-latency modules in micro-frontend environments.

Component Modularity: Employs standalone components with clear input/output dependencies, allowing for easy integration into larger hosting applications.

Derived State: Implements computed signals for derived metrics (like BMI and BMR), ensuring calculations are efficient and only run when dependencies change (performance optimization).

TypeScript Typing: Strict adherence to explicit interfaces (HealthMetric) for data consistency and developer experience.
